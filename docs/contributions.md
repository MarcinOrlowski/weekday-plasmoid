## Contributions ##

If you want to contribute to this project, then you are **more than welcome**! But let me ask you to
follow a few simple rules to make our lives easier:

 * If you want to provide new feature or fix a bug - please [create a new ticket](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/weekday-plasmoid/issues) **first**. That would let us coordinate the works.
 * You should **always** send pull request against **dev** branch. This will save us a lot
   of time while merging later. I will not not accept PRs against `master`, just because of
   that, as `dev` changes more often than `master` branch, so if we cannot merge with `dev`
   right now, we will not be able to merge with `master` later, as all  the PRs are always
   merged with `dev` first, and hen go to `master` ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
