## Contributions ##

If you want to contribute to this project, then you are **more than welcome**! But let me ask you to
follow a few simple rules to make our lives easier:

 * If you want to provide new feature or fix a bug - please [create a new ticket](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/weekday-plasmoid/issues) **first**. That would let us coordinate the works.
 * You should **always** send pull request against **dev** branch. This will save us a lot
   of time while merging later. I will not not accept PRs agains 'master', just because of
   that. I also understand that 'dev' may change more often than 'master' but if we cannot
   merge with 'dev' now, then we will not be able to merge agains 'master' later once all
   the PRs are merged into 'dev' which is then merged into 'master' ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
